        <h2>Best Tasting Gluten Free Waffles Ever!</h2>
        <p>
            An easy gluten-free waffle recipe with a few simple ingredients that make fluffy, soft on the inside, and crispy waffles every time. You won't even be able to tell the difference between these and traditional gluten filled waffles. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>160 grams Cassava Flour</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Baking Powder </li>
            <li>2 Scoops Collagen (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp Maple Syrup</li>
            <li>2 Eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your waffle iron to medium. If you normally have to grease your iron make sure it's well greased.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl whisk together cassava flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and collagen</li>

            <li>Separate your eggs and add the yolks to the dry ingredients. In a medium bowl beat eggs until stiff peaks form. I use an immersion blender with a whisk attachment, but a hand mixer will work also</li>

            <li>Add vanilla extract, ghee, and milk to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. Fold in egg whites. The batter should be thick</li>

            <li>Spoon the batter into your waffle iron and cook per your iron's specifications or until there is no longer any steam. In my waffle iron it takes ~ 5 minutes. Waffles will be crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside</li>

            <li>Serve warm or freeze for another day</li>
        </ol>
