        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lbs Chicken Wings</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Onion Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Paprika</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp Black Pepper, divided</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>5 cloves Garlic</li>
            <li>5 tbsp Butter</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil (for easy clean-up) and place a wire rack on top. If you don't have a wire rack, line your baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil and spray with non-stick cooking spray</li>
            
            <li>Pat the chicken wings dry with paper towels (this is key to crispy chicken wings!) Transfer them to a large bowl</li>

            <li>Combine the baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ½ a teaspoon of black pepper in a small bowl. Mix</li>

            <li>Sprinkle the chicken wings and drumettes with the seasoning mixture. Try to coat each piece of chicken evenly</li>

            <li>Transfer the seasoned chicken pieces to your prepared baking sheet. Do not overlap the chicken pieces (this will prevent them from crisping over their entire surface). Bake for approximately 25-35 minutes, flipping at 15 minutes. Cook until the skin is golden and crispy and the chicken is fully cooked (internal temperature of 165°F)</li>

            <li>Set the oven to broil, high. Broil the chicken until browned (not burned). This takes around 4-6 minutes, so keep a close watch</li>

            <li>As the chicken cooks, prepare the garlic parmesan sauce</li>

            <li>Heat the olive oil in a small saucepot set over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant – about 1 minute. Stir continuously to prevent the garlic from burning. Add the butter and let it melt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent the butter and garlic from burning. Remove from heat and stir in the grated parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, hot sauce, and remaining ½ teaspoon of salt and ½ teaspoon of black pepper </li>

            <li>Remove the wings from the oven and transfer them to a large bowl. While they are still hot, pour the garlic parmesan sauce over the wings, using cooking tongs to gently toss them in the sauce until they are all coated in sauce</li>

            <li>If desired, sprinkle with additional grated parmesan cheese or fresh minced parsley</li>
        </ol>
